#### You are not lazy.
\
"I just can't get myself to start this thing."\
"I'm such a procrastinator."\
"I'm so lazy."

You, my fellow programmer, have learned languages and solved problems. You have spent countless hours asking questions and answering them. You are a detective, an architect, a designer, a writer, a researcher. You, my friend, are **not** lazy.

I reject the idea that when I hit this wall, I must force myself to continue. I reject the idea that it is a personal failure to lose motivation.

The practical suggestions to combat stalled progress often include using lists, marking deadlines, and something involving sticky notes. I do believe these things can be helpful, especially when looking to improve efficiency or organization.

But when you're really stuck?\
Like when you're "staring at your phone or the wall for the past 13 weekends feeling more and more guilty about not working on the thing, causing you to dislike even thinking about it" stuck?

Here's what seems to help me.

1. **Acceptance.** I can stop the cycle of guilt immediately by just deciding **not** to do this task at all. No more pushing it to next week, no more feeling like I'm behind schedule.

2. **Indulgence.** Instead, I'll focus on whatever I *do* feel like doing. Something that requires no convincing. Pursue a totally different hobby. Re-binge *The Wire*. Catch up some extra, guilt-free sleep. The important parts here are to 1) reset my mind and 2) reclaim that feeling of joy.

3. **Recovery.** The emotional toll of feeling guilty about not doing something is heavy. If I'm not recovered, just thinking about the original project can still overwhelm me with a sinking, deflated feeling. Depending on how deeply I was "stuck", I could need a break for a few days or even years to really heal.

4. **Analysis & adjustment.** Once I feel ready, I can take a critical look at the project I wanted to tackle. What threw me off? What changes could I make that would make it more appealing? Some common types of changes include:

  - **Scope.** This task might be too large for me in my current circumstances. I'm far likelier to commit to a smaller, well-defined task (ex. "make a 3d sphere appear in the browser") than a large, ambiguous one (ex. "start building a 3d game"). I can always (and very often do) expand it as I go.

  - **The right level of challenge.** If it's very similar to work I've done before, it might feel boring. On the other hand, if there are too many unknowns, I might not know where to even start. The delicate balance of familiarity vs. challenge is key to sparking motivation.

  - **Subject matter.** Am I tackling this project because it actually moves me? Is the idea fascinating? Beautiful? Hilarious? If I'm leaning towards words like "interesting", "useful", or "cool", I might have just picked this project because that's what I *should* be doing. Says who?

5. **Repeat.** Sometimes I'm able to go through these steps, pinpoint a change, and the inspiration seems to just flow back. But usually - and especially when I'm already at lowered capacity (maybe due to a global pandemic?) - I find that one round of this process doesn't quite get me there. So I put the laptop down again. Cut the scope down again. Think of some new ideas. Play some video games. Try again next weekend.

I mentioned this could take years. It's particularly difficult after having practiced a skill for a long time without spending time on **why**, like many things we pick up as kids. I've played piano since I was 3, and it's still difficult to enjoy without feeling guilty and frustrated.

I remember trying to learn "how to code" several times, with zero success. It was always somehow boring and impossibly difficult at the same time. But years later, I tried instead to just learn "how to make a button on a website change colors" and, well, now I'm a software engineer.

When I'm feeling stuck, it's not because I'm lazy. It's because there's some sort of conflict to debug. Besides, the best things seem to happen not when I'm churning through tasks at high speed, but when I try to understand myself better - what brings me joy, what motivates me.
