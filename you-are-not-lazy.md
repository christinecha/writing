#### You are not lazy.
\
"I just can't get myself to start this thing."\
"I'm such a procrastinator."\
"I'm so lazy."

You, my fellow programmer, have learned languages and solved problems. You have spent countless hours asking questions and answering them. You are a detective, an architect, a designer, a writer, a researcher. You, my friend, are **not** lazy.

I reject the idea that when I hit this wall, I must force myself to continue. I reject the idea that it is a personal failure to lose motivation.

The practical suggestions to combat stalled progress often include using lists, marking deadlines, and something involving sticky notes. I do believe these things can be helpful, especially when looking to improve efficiency or organization.

But when you're really stuck?\
Like when you're "staring at your phone or the wall for the past 13 weekends feeling more and more guilty about not working on the thing, causing you to dislike even thinking about it" stuck?

Here's what seems to help me.

1. **Acceptance.** I can stop the cycle of guilt immediately by just deciding **not** to do this task at all. No more pushing it to next week, no more feeling like I'm behind schedule.

2. **Indulgence.** Instead, I'll focus on whatever I *do* feel like doing. Something that requires no convincing. Pursue a totally different hobby. Re-binge *The Wire*. Catch up some extra, guilt-free sleep. The important parts here are to 1) reset my mind and 2) reclaim that feeling of joy.

3. **Don't look back.** You need to give yourself a real break. Clear your mind. You're not ready to return to the original task if just thinking of it still gives you a sinking, deflated feeling. (Note: This could take a few days or a few years!)

4. **Analyze.** Once you're ready, take a critical look at the project you wanted to tackle. What changes could be made that would make it more appealing to you? Some common categories of changes include:
  - Scope. The task might be too large for me in my current circumstances. Cut it way down. I like to try and commit to the smallest possible thing at first (ex. "I'll just try cloning down someone else's project and changing some things around") because concrete goals are easier for me to swallow. Besides, I usually am too curious to stay within the bounds anyway!
  - Unknowns. Motivation can easily be broken or revived from a delicate balance of familiarity and challenge. If it's very similar to work I've done before, it probably feels boring. On the other hand, if there are too many unknowns, I might not know where to even start.
  - Subject matter. Am I tackling this project because it actually moves you? Fascinating? Beautiful? Hilarious? If I'm leaning towards words like "interesting", "useful", or "cool", it's likely I mainly assigned myself this task because it's what I *should* be doing. Says who?

5. **Repeat.** Sometimes, I'm able to go through these steps, pinpoint a change, and the inspiration seems to just flow back. But usually - and especially when I'm already at lowered capacity (maybe due to a global pandemic?) - I find that one round of this process doesn't quite get me there. So I put it the laptop down again. Cut the scope down again. Make some changes. Play some video games. Try again next weekend.

I mentioned this might take years, and I wasn't kidding. Particularly if you've forced yourself to practice a skill for a long time without spending the time on why. I've played piano since I was 3, and it's still difficult to return to the keys without anxiety and frustration.

I remember trying to learn "how to code" several times, with zero success. It was always somehow boring and impossibly difficult at the same time. But years later, I tried instead to just learn "how to make a button on a website change colors" and, well, I'm a software engineer now.

Nothing about this process is quick or easy. But if there's anything I've learned from my experiences, particularly around self-teaching, it's that learning to love doing something is even more important - and yields better long-term results - than just making yourself do the thing.
