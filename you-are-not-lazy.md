#### You are not lazy.

"I just can't get myself to start this thing."\
"I'm such a procrastinator."\
"I'm so lazy."

You, my fellow programmer, have learned languages and built worlds. You have spent countless hours asking questions and answering them. You are a detective, an architect, a designer, a writer, a researcher, an artist. You, my friend, are **not** lazy.

I reject the idea that when I hit this wall, I must force myself to continue. I reject the idea that it is a personal failure to lose motivation.

The practical suggestions to combat stalled progress often include using lists, marking deadlines, and something involving sticky notes. I do believe these things can be helpful, especially when looking to improve efficiency or organization.

But when you're *really* stuck?

Like when you're "staring at your phone or the wall for the past 13 weekends feeling more and more guilty about not working on the thing, causing you to dislike even thinking about it" stuck?

Here's what seems to help me.

1. **Acceptance.** I can stop the cycle of guilt immediately by just deciding **not** to do this task at all. No more pushing it to next week, no more feeling like I'm behind schedule.

2. **Indulgence.** Instead, I'll focus on whatever I *do* feel like doing. Something that requires no convincing. Pursue a totally different hobby. Re-binge *The Wire*. Catch up some extra, guilt-free sleep. The important parts here are to 1) reset my mind and 2) reclaim that feeling of joy.

3. **Recovery.** The emotional toll of feeling guilty about not doing something is heavy. If I'm not recovered, just thinking about the original project can still overwhelm me with a sinking, deflated feeling. Depending on how deeply I was "stuck", I could need a break for a few days or even years to really heal.

4. **Analysis & adjustment.** Once I feel ready, I can take a critical look at the project I wanted to tackle. What threw me off? What changes could I make that would make it more appealing? Some common types of changes include:

  - **Scope.** This task might be too large for me in my current circumstances. I'm far likelier to commit to a smaller, well-defined task (ex. "make a 3d sphere appear in the browser") than a large, ambiguous one (ex. "start building a 3d game"). I can always (and very often do) expand it as I go.

  - **The right level of challenge.** If it's very similar to work I've done before, it might feel boring. On the other hand, if there are too many unknowns, I might not know where to even start. The delicate balance of familiarity vs. challenge is key to sparking motivation.

  - **Subject matter.** Am I tackling this project because it actually moves me? Is the idea fascinating? Beautiful? Hilarious? If I'm leaning towards words like "interesting", "useful", or "cool", I might have just picked this project because that's what I *should* be doing. Says who?

5. **Repeat.** Sometimes I'm able to go through these steps, pinpoint a change, and the inspiration seems to just flow back. But usually - and especially when I'm already at lowered capacity (maybe due to a global pandemic?) - I find that one round of this process doesn't quite get me there. So I put the laptop down again. Cut the scope down again. Think of some new ideas. Play some video games. Try again next weekend.

I mentioned this could take years. It's particularly difficult after having practiced a skill for a long time without spending time on **why**, like many things we pick up as kids. I've played piano since I was 3, and now as an adult it's tough to enjoy without negative thoughts (frustration, guilt, shame) flooding in at the first wrong note. I still haven't pinpointed exactly what I love about playing after all these years, but I'm working on it.

In contrast, I remember trying to learn "how to code" a few times, with zero success. It was always somehow boring yet impossible at the same time, and I dropped the idea of ever becoming a developer. Years later, I wanted to improve my skills as a designer by learning "how to change the color of a button" and, well, now I'm a software engineer.

So far, I still *love* writing code. I attribute a large portion of that to how clear - and limited - my initial intent was. When I saw my button change color for the first time, I was absolutely thrilled. It wasn't a career goal, or a self-imposed obligation. I was (and am still!) just chasing that excitement.

When I'm feeling stuck, it's not because I'm lazy. It's because that excitement isn't there. It's because there's some sort of conflict; something isn't right. So let's do our programming duty and start debugging.
